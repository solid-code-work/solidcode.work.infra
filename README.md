# 📖 About solidcode.work.infra

Starting a new web application often means repeating the same setup steps: configuring databases, wiring up caching, adding messaging, setting up HTTP clients, and pulling in all the common packages. This process is time‑consuming, error‑prone, and something every developer ends up doing again and again for each project.

I built **solidcode.work.infra** to make this process easy, fast, and standardized. Instead of spending hours on boilerplate setup, you can install this package from NuGet and immediately have a ready‑to‑use infrastructure layer that follows best practices and is consistent across projects.

By utilizing this package:

🚀 You can start projects faster with the essential building blocks already in place.  
⚙️ Your applications are standardized and collaborative, reducing friction when working in teams.  
📦 Common integrations (databases, caching, messaging, HTTP, logging) are pre‑configured and ready to extend.  

This library is the backbone of my portfolio and reflects my approach to building clean, modular, and reusable infrastructure code for modern .NET applications. It’s designed to save time, enforce consistency, and let you focus on the unique parts of your project instead of reinventing the wheel.
